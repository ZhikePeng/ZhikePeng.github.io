I am a senior undergraduate student at Tsinghua Universityâ€™s Zhili College, and I will soon pursue a direct Ph.D. under the supervision of Professor Jing Chen in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University. My research interests are broad and interdisciplinary, including graph theory, game theory, blockchain, as well as deep learning, reinforcement learning theory, and world models.
